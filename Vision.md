# 🌍 Vision — 2030 and Beyond

The R3C Foundation envisions a future where compiler infrastructure  
is sustainable, sovereign, and reproducible across generations.

### 🎯 Long-Term Goals

| Category | Goal |
|:--|:--|
| **Compiler** | Achieve fully LLVM-free C++ ↔ Rust → NASM pipeline |
| **Ecosystem** | Integrate reproducible package and CI/CD frameworks |
| **Education** | Publish R3C curriculum for compiler sustainability |
| **Governance** | Transition into self-sustaining neutral foundation |
| **Hardware** | Support embedded LTSS targets (ARM, RISC-V, x86) |

---

### 🧩 Foundation Vision Model

1. **Phase 0–2:** Build, stabilize, and prove reproducibility  
2. **Phase 3:** Establish open foundation governance  
3. **Phase 4+:** Maintain LTSS versions for decades  
4. **Phase ∞:** Enable education, research, and industrial certification

---

### 🌐 2030+ Projection

- LTSS compilers reproducible 10+ years  
- Global recognition as the first LLVM-independent Rust ecosystem  
- Rust-LTSS and R3C jointly serve as “Post-LLVM Education Infrastructure”  
- Autonomous funding via open foundations (OpenCollective, GitHub Sponsors)

> The future belongs to reproducibility, not rapid obsolescence.
