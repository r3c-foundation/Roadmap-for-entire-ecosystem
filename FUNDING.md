# 💰 Funding & Sustainability — LTSS Support Model

The **R3C Foundation** operates under a *non-commercial, deferred funding model*  
to comply with public service regulations and ensure full transparency.

---

### 📜 Policy

- **No personal income** is received or withdrawn until **post-2027** (after official service completion).  
- All incoming funds remain **in foundation escrow** (OpenCollective holding account).  
- Donations are classified as **ecosystem reinvestment**, not individual profit.  
- Full transaction records will be made publicly available through yearly transparency reports.  

This ensures that all contributions support infrastructure and reproducibility — not personal gain.
