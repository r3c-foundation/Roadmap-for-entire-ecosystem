# 🏛️ R3C Foundation — Roadmap for the Ecosystem

> “We are not escaping LLVM — we are transcending it.”

The **R3C Ecosystem** is a long-term, LLVM-independent compiler framework.  
It connects **C++ → Rust → NASM** under a reproducible, self-hosting, and open governance model.

---

## 🌍 Vision

- **Compiler Sovereignty** — Languages must breathe without centralized engines.  
- **Transparency** — Every artifact is reproducible, verifiable, and auditable.  
- **Longevity (LTSS)** — Designed for 2030+ sustainability in research and embedded systems.  
- **Neutral Governance** — Operates under open and transparent foundation principles.

> “Languages should not depend on a single engine —  
> they should learn to breathe on their own.”

## 🧩 Ecosystem Layers

| Layer | Repository | Purpose |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Core Compiler | [r3c](https://github.com/r3c-foundation/r3c) | LLVM-free C++ ↔ Rust transpiler |
| Package Manager | [cpppm](https://github.com/r3c-foundation/cpppm) | C++ dependency ecosystem & build meta-layer |
| Rust LTSS | [rust-ltss](https://github.com/r3c-foundation/rust-ltss) | Frozen Rust 1.70+ compiler (Long-Term Sustain System) |
| Pipeline Core | [beyond-llvm](https://github.com/r3c-foundation/beyond-llvm) | Post-LLVM backend & reproducible NASM emitter |
| Documentation | [roadmap-for-r3c](https://github.com/r3c-foundation/roadmap-for-r3c) | Strategic documentation for the entire ecosystem |

## 🧱 Roadmap Phases

| Phase | Codename | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Phase 0 — Bootstrap Baseline** | `Emit Sovereign Rust` | Establish a reproducible Rust 1.70 baseline and build the first R3C compiler binary. |
| **Phase 1 — Transpiler Maturity** | `Bridge C++ ↔ Rust` | Achieve stable bidirectional translation and reproducible builds across OS targets. |
| **Phase 2 — Post-LLVM Expansion** | `Beyond LLVM` | Integrate NASM backend, remove LLVM dependencies, and unify CMake + cargo CI systems. |
| **Phase 3 — Foundation Era** | `Autonomous Governance` | Transition to open foundation model, publish yearly “Ecosystem Manifesto”, and freeze LTSS versions. |

## 🏗️ Long-Term Sustain System (LTSS)

- Rust LTSS (frozen 1.70+) as the immutable baseline for all compiler reproducibility tests  
- LTSS policy ensures reproducibility > 10 years  
- Independent, reproducible CI pipeline via 3-OS autonomous workflows  
- Annual integrity audit with checksum verification of all builds  

---

## 🧭 Governance Principles

- **Open Source First** — No closed components, ever.  
- **Neutral Research** — All work published under MIT license and public domain docs.  
- **Determinism** — Every phase verified by byte-level reproducibility.  
- **Longevity over Velocity** — Focus on infrastructure that lasts, not releases that fade.
