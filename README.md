🧭 Roadmap for Entire R3C Ecosystem


“We are not escaping LLVM — we are transcending it.”

A documentation repository for the post-LLVM, Rust-independent compiler era.





🌐 Purpose


This repository serves as the central document hub for the R3C ecosystem —

the place where vision, bootstrap path, and future coordination converge.


It defines the long-term structure, technical boundaries, and philosophical direction

of all R3C-related projects.



🧩 Phase 0 — Bootstrap Baseline


First, choose one stable Rust version and compile with R3C.

This becomes the sovereign baseline of the ecosystem.


git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/rust.git
cd rust
git checkout 1.76.0
r3c build library/core
r3c build library/alloc
r3c build library/std



Tag this as the first checkpoint:


git tag -a v0.1-bootstrap-rust-1.76 -m "Bootstrap baseline"





This step represents independence through reproducibility.

They should learn to breathe on their own.”
